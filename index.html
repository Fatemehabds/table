              <p align="justify" style="line-height: 1.5">
            <b>Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer</b> ( May 21, 1960 – November 28, 1994),
            also known as the <b>Milwaukee Cannibal</b> or the
            <b>Milwaukee Monster</b>, was an American serial killer and sex
            offender who committed the murder and dismemberment of seventeen men
            and boys between 1978 and 1991.Many of his later murders involved
            necrophilia,cannibalism, and the permanent preservation of body
            parts typically all or part of the skeleton. <br />

            Although he was diagnosed with borderline personality
            disorder,schizotypal personality disorder, and a psychotic disorder,
            Dahmer was found to be legally sane at his trial. He was convicted
            of fifteen of the sixteen murders he had committed in Wisconsin and
            was sentenced to fifteen terms of life imprisonment on February 17,
            1992. Dahmer was later sentenced to a sixteenth term of life
            imprisonment for an additional homicide committed in Ohio in 1978.
            From an early age, Dahmer manifested an interest in dead animals.
            His fascination with dead animals may have begun when, at the age of
            four, he saw his father removing animal bones from beneath the
            family home. According to Lionel, Dahmer was "oddly thrilled" by the
            sound the bones made, and became preoccupied with animal bones,
            which he initially called his "fiddlesticks". He occasionally
            searched beneath and around the family home for additional bones,
            and explored the bodies of live animals to discover where their
            bones were located. <br />
            When he reached puberty, Dahmer discovered he was gay; he did not
            tell his parents. In his early teens, he had a brief relationship
            with another teenage boy, although they never had intercourse. By
            Dahmer's later admission, he began fantasizing about dominating and
            controlling a completely submissive male partner in his early to
            mid-teens, and his masturbatory fantasies gradually evolved to his
            focusing upon the chests and torsos of the focus of his fantasies.
            These fantasies gradually became intertwined with dissection.] When
            he was about 16, Dahmer conceived a fantasy of rendering unconscious
            a particular male jogger he found attractive, and then making sexual
            use of his body. On one occasion Dahmer concealed himself in bushes
            with a baseball bat to lie in wait for this man; however, he did not
            pass by on that particular day.] Dahmer later said this was his
            first attempt to attack someone. <br />
            In May 1978, Dahmer graduated from high school. A few weeks before
            his graduation, one of his teachers observed Dahmer sitting close to
            the school parking lot, drinking several cans of beer. When the
            teacher threatened to report the matter, Dahmer informed him he was
            experiencing "a lot of problems" at home and that the school's
            guidance counselor was aware of them. That spring, Joyce and David
            moved out of the family home to live with relatives in Chippewa
            Falls, Wisconsin. Dahmer had just turned 18 and remained in the
            family home.

                Dahmer committed his <b>first murder</b> in 1978, three weeks
                after his graduation. On June 18, Dahmer picked up a
                <b>hitchhiker</b> named
                <span style="color: red"><b>Steven Mark Hicks</b> </span>, who
                was almost 19. Dahmer lured the youth to his house on the
                pretext of drinking. Hicks, who had been hitchhiking to a rock
                concert at Chippewa Lake Park, Ohio, agreed to accompany Dahmer
                to his house upon the promise of "a few beers" with Dahmer as he
                had the house to himself. According to Dahmer, the sight of the
                bare-chested Hicks standing at the roadside stirred his sexual
                feelings, although when Hicks began talking about girls, he knew
                any sexual passes he made would be rebuffed. After several hours
                of talking, drinking and listening to music, Hicks "wanted to
                leave and [I] didn't want him to." Dahmer bludgeoned Hicks with
                a 10-pound (4.5 kg) dumbbell. He later stated he struck Hicks
                twice from behindwith the dumbbell as Hicks sat upon a chair.
                When Hicks fell unconscious, Dahmer strangled him to death with
                the bar of the dumbbell, then stripped the clothes from Hicks'
                body before exploring his chest with his hands, then
                masturbating as he stood above the corpse. The following day,
                Dahmer dissected Hicks' body in his basement; he later buried
                the remains in a shallow grave in his backyard before, several
                weeks later, unearthing the remains and paring the flesh from
                the bones. He dissolved the flesh in acid before flushing the
                solution down the toilet; he crushed the bones with a
                sledgehammer and scattered them in the woodland behind the
                family home.    
                <br />
                On September 8, 1986, Dahmer was arrested upon a charge of
                <span style="color: red"
                  ><b>lewd and lascivious behavior</b>
                </span>
                for masturbating in the presence of two 12-year-old boys as he
                stood close to the Kinnickinnic River. He initially claimed he
                had merely been urinating, unaware that there were witnesses,
                but soon admitted the offense. The charge was changed to
                disorderly conduct and, on March 10, 1987, Dahmer was sentenced
                to one year of probation, with additional instructions he was to
                undergo counseling.
                <br />
                <b> On November 20, 1987</b>, Dahmer at the time residing with
                his grandmother in West Allis encountered a 25-year-old man from
                Ontonagon, Michigan,
                <span style="color: red"><b>Steven Tuomi</b> </span>, at a bar
                and persuaded him to return to the Ambassador Hotel in
                Milwaukee, where Dahmer had rented a room for the evening.
                According to Dahmer, he had no intention of murdering Tuomi, but
                rather intended to simply drug him and lie beside him as he
                explored his body. The following morning, however, Dahmer awoke
                to find Tuomi lying beneath him on the bed, his chest "crushed
                in" and "black and blue" with bruises. Blood was also seeping
                from the corner of his mouth, and Dahmer's fists and one forearm
                were extensively bruised. Dahmer stated he had no memory of
                having killed Tuomi, and later informed investigators that he
                "could not believe this had happened." To dispose of Tuomi's
                body, Dahmer purchased a large suitcase in which he transported
                the body to his grandmother's residence. There, one week later
                he severed the head, arms, and legs from the torso, then
                filleted the bones from the body before cutting the flesh into
                pieces small enough to handle. Dahmer then placed the flesh
                inside plastic garbage bags. He wrapped the bones inside a sheet
                and pounded them into splinters with a sledgehammer. The entire
                dismemberment process took Dahmer approximately two hours to
                complete, and he disposed of all of Tuomi's remains excluding
                the severed head in the trash. For a total of two weeks
                following Tuomi's murder, Dahmer retained the victim's head
                wrapped in a blanket. After two weeks, Dahmer boiled the head in
                a mixture of Soilex (an alkali-based industrial detergent) and
                bleach in an effort to retain the skull, which he then used as
                stimulus for masturbation.
                <br />
                Eventually, the skull was rendered too brittle by this bleaching
                process, so Dahmer pulverized and disposed of it Following the
                murder of Tuomi, Dahmer began to actively seek victims, most of
                whom he encountered in or close to gay bars, and whom he
                typically lured to his grandmother's home. He would drug his
                victim with triazolam or temazepam before or shortly after
                engaging in sexual activity with them. Once he had rendered his
                victim unconscious with sleeping pills, he killed them by
                strangulation.Two months after the Tuomi murder, Dahmer
                encountered a 14-year-old Native American male prostitute named
                <span style="color: red"><b>James Doxtator</b> </span> ; Dahmer
                lured the youth to his home with an offer of $50 to pose for
                nude pictures. At Dahmer's West Allis residence, the pair
                engaged in sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Doxtator and
                strangled him on the floor of the cellar. Dahmer left the body
                in the cellar for one week before dismembering it in much the
                same manner as he had with Tuomi. He placed all of Doxtator's
                remains (excluding the skull) in the trash. The skull was boiled
                and cleansed in bleach before Dahmer noted it had been rendered
                too brittle by this process. He pulverized the skull two weeks
                later.
                <br>
                 <b>On March 24, 1988</b> , Dahmer met a 22-year-old
                bisexual man named
                <span style="color: red"><b>Richard Guerrero</b></span> outside
                a gay bar called The Phoenix. Dahmer lured Guerrero to his
                grandmother's residence, although the incentive on this occasion
                was $50 to simply spend the remainder of the night with him; he
                then drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills and strangled him with
                a leather strap, with Dahmer then performing oral sex upon the
                corpse. Dahmer dismembered Guerrero's body within 24 hours of
                murdering him, again disposing of the remains in the trash and
                retaining the skull before pulverizing it several months later…
